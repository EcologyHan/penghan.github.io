abstract: The equilibrium theory of island biogeography predicts the positive species–area relationship and the negative species–isolation relationship, resulting in higher species richness on large and close islands. Unlike species richness, soundscape diversity integrates sound from various sources (e.g. biophony, geophony and anthrophony). However, how soundscape diversity varies with island area and isolation still needs to be tested. Here, we explored the island biogeography of bird soundscapes and the determinants of island attributes in shaping bird diversity and soundscape diversity....
